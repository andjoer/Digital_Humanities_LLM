3055_3068	goldLabel	a1	changing from fossil fuels to clean energy is a highly costly move because the government would have to build new nuclear power plants, at the expense of using that money to deal better with pollution	given the two main problems with fossil fuels are that fossil fuels usage is extremely air pollution and that thay are consumeable, their usage does not immediately harm anyone and so should not be banned.
3033_3016	goldLabel	a2	many current workplaces are based on the use and production of fossil fuels, thus banning it will result in great unemployment	fossil fuels are cheap sources of energy the allow us to create and move commodities cheaply, therefore reducing the costs of everything we buy or consume

3026_3054	goldLabel	a2	the free market is solving this as we speak. there is no need to ban fossil fuels, as we are already creating alternatives that don't need the interim turmoil	we should not ban fossil fuels because it would actually be more wasteful to stop using perfectly good infrastructure decades before it wears out, especially given the huge up front costs.

3038_3026	goldLabel	a1	we should not ban fossil fuels because in many places there simply is no alternative and we cannot treat the people who live there as less valuable than others.	the free market is solving this as we speak. there is no need to ban fossil fuels, as we are already creating alternatives that don't need the interim turmoil
3055_3041	goldLabel	a1	changing from fossil fuels to clean energy is a highly costly move because the government would have to build new nuclear power plants, at the expense of using that money to deal better with pollution	fossil fuels are located in countries with politically controversial agendas. the mutual dependence of diverse energy producers and buyers create deals and interactions between countries. we need fossils as they are the base for deals.
3025_3053	goldLabel	a1	this will give rise to nuclear energy which will make the world a much more dangerous place	fossil fuels are the only way to power war meachins like tanks and planse that are needed to defend countrys

3021_3026	goldLabel	a1	jobs destroyed by a ban won't be replaced with jobs for as low of a level of education (since greener energy needs more researchers and engineers than miners), leaving many permanently out of work.	the free market is solving this as we speak. there is no need to ban fossil fuels, as we are already creating alternatives that don't need the interim turmoil
3044_3017	goldLabel	a1	banning fossil fuels would bring down huge companies supporting lots of workers that would be sent home with no means to help their families	countries try to break dependence of controversial countries and want to create more stable market. thus they are already looking for alternative energy sources. no need to entirely ban.
3028_3016	goldLabel	a2	world is largely based on technology. technology is currently largely based on fossil energy. banning it would not allow people to properly use technology and urge them to use primitive devices.	fossil fuels are cheap sources of energy the allow us to create and move commodities cheaply, therefore reducing the costs of everything we buy or consume
3023_3057	goldLabel	a1	fossil fuels are the cheapest and most common form of energy there is, so it is far more available to the poor who can't afford anything else	today we are too much dependent on fossil fuels and the share of clean energy is not high enough, so we can't ban it with no sufficient alternatives
