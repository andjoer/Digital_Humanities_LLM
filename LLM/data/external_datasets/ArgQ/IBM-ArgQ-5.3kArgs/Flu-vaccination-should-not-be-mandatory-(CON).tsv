1097	0.7142857140000001	Flu vaccination should not be mandatory because an average person can weigh the risk of the flu, a familiar illness, against the unhappiness produced by the vaccine and make their own decision.

1101	0.8888888890000001	Flu vaccine should not be mandatory because some individuals are immunocompromised or allergic to components of the vaccine. We cannot force injury on these individuals to protect others.
1102	0.9090909090000001	Flu vaccines are relatively safe, but not absolutely safe. Adverse effects, while uncommon, are nonetheless real.
1104	0.181818182	Flu vaccines shouldn't be mandatory. We already mandate childhood vaccines for serious diseases. Big Pharma cannot be trusted. Government oversight is lax. If we're so concerned about the public good, why isn't there strong gun regulation?

1492	0.444444444	Given most deseases spread in more ways than by humans, and given most people are vaccinated, the profit to society (or damage to it) is n&eacute;gligeable and therefor not worth limiting people's freedom over
1697	0.5	If parents refuse to vaccinate their children, taking their money or taking their kids out of school would hurt the children even though they have no culpability.

1711	0.333333333	If there are issues in production or application with the vaccine, public trust in the government will be destroyed.
1816	0.5	Increased demand for healthcare increases wait times for all people, which blocks people from getting important healthcare.

2189	0.5	Mandating vaccination is much more restrictive than educating the population, so people get vaccinated by choice.
2192	0.846153846	Mandatory vaccines infringe upon constitutionally protected religious freedoms.
2212	0.615384615	Many minority groups have been historically harmed by medical institutions and so distrust the system, the government shouldn't be forcing these people into that system after being responsible for harm caused.
2229	0.857142857	Many people have deep held beliefs against vaccination, such as religious beliefs, and the government should not trample upon the values of those people and violate their consent by forcing them to get vaccinated.
2315	0.615384615	Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases, thus making vaccines unnecessary.
2650	0.428571429	Opposition to vaccines is valid as the government and doctors have used their powers to harm marginalized groups before.
2687	0.625	People are already well aware of the harms of the flu and the benefits of vaccination, meaning that the government should allow people to make the decisions they deem best for themselves.
2690	0.333333333	People are entitled to make bad medical decisions.
2693	0.4	"People are likely to feel that they have ""done their part"" and not opt into other vaccinations - which are often more important, as they prevent more severe diseases."
2695	0.46153846200000004	People are more likely to draw conspiracy theories about vaccination because it looks state is making something which is contested mandatory, looks like illegitimate intersts

2755	0.28571428600000004	People often don't get the flu vaccine based on conventional or emotional wisdom, mandating a flu vaccine makes them feel attacked but does nothing to promote fact based decision making or scientific awareness.
2807	0.28571428600000004	People will lie about getting the vaccine to avoid this regulation.
2947	0.4	Religious reasons not to get vaccinated are more important than marginally contributing to herd immunity since the potential for hell is infinite.
3009	0.454545455	Several of Canadas leading flu researchers have also noted the lack of evidence that vaccination of healthcare workers reduces the incidence of flu in patients.
3037	0.647058824	Since flu strains mutate constantly and any given flu vaccine is just a scientist's guess of what will be the flu strain that year, the flu vaccine is very rarely effective.
3869	0.545454545	Some people are allergic to the ingredients in the flu vaccine. Others may be taking medications (such as immunosupresants) that would put them at risk if they took the vaccine.

4022	0.8888888890000001	The constitution does not grant the government the right to do this. The government also defines all powers that the government has, so it would be violating its contractual agreements with the people.
4038	0.0	The disease would grow stronger by mutating on the entire population, it is best to save it for really sick oeople
4064	0.5	The flu is not a dangerous enough disease to justify the transgression of personal autonomy brought about by vaccines.
4065	0.444444444	The flu is only deadly for a small group of at-risk people who should take it upon themselves to protect themselves but that does not mean everyone should risk vaccination side effects.

4094	0.428571429	The government has proven it cannot be trusted with mandated healthcare due to eugenics programs in the past.
4098	0.7142857140000001	The government shouldn't pass policies that are likely to disproportionately target sub-sects of the population since this is unfair and entrenches cycles of oppression, mandating flu vaccines disproportionately hurts poorer people and people of color.
4102	0.642857143	The government should not intervene in personal medical choices.
4107	0.666666667	The harm caused by the flu isn't large enough to justify this level of intrusion into people's freedom of choice. This may be legitimate for measles, but not flu.

4212	0.705882353	The public does not support this kind of policy and the government must always prioritize the will of the people.
4275	0.428571429	The vaccination would protect you for just one year, the gain in marginal so the expected value is small compared to the unlikely but significant damage
4296	0.666666667	There are a number of potential side effects of the flu vaccine that lead to more harm than good, meaning people should be able to decide for themselves whether to vaccinate or not.

4313	0.428571429	There are more important public health projects that deserve our attention and resources, such as cancer research.

4533	0.5	Vaccinations could harm the person getting vaccinated by getting infected, thus harming him more than protecting
4534	1.0	Vaccinations have side effects of pain and weakness, and their effectiveness is only partial. A person has the right and the ability to make a conscious decision whether to vaccinate himself or not.

4963	0.5555555560000001	When we force vaccines, we take away the incentives for the health system to engage with the public and explain the importance of vaccines. In the long terms, this leads to less public trust.
4967	0.818181818	While I believe that flu vaccines are beneficial to people, I do not believe they should be mandatory because I should have a right to decide if I want to take a risk with my health.
4984	0.363636364	While vaccinations are important, there are legitimate concerns regarding vaccination injuries and everyone should weigh the risks of both the flu and the possible side effects for themselves, as that is what democracy is about.
5070	0.75	You can not force people to inject substances they do not want to their bodies.
5074	0.3	You do not have to make vaccinations mandatory. Positive incentives can be given to people to get vaccinated, thus immunizing most of the population without the use of force.

5381	0.571428571	taking away the opportunity from an individual to decide for himself is immoral. he should be able to decide if he wants to get vaccinated or not.
5387	0.28571428600000004	the body has an automatic vaccination due to evolution, those who got sick and died are the weakest link and we are better off without them
5414	0.42105263200000004	there are people who are ideologically opposed to shots, and it will be immoral for us to force such things against them
