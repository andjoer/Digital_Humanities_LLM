5007	0.615384615	With autonomous cars that have network capability, they could work as a swarm and drive more efficiently as a collective. Tighter gaps between cars and efficient lane switching. Traffic light co-ordination etc.
5008	0.727272727	"With autonomous vehicles, travel time can be productive or entertainment, whereas nowadays people spend a lot of time commuting which is ""wasted"" on the driving activity."
5009	0.454545455	With continued development, autonomous vehicles may someday drive more safely than vehicles operated by humans.
5011	0.75	With driverless cars, overall fewer people will be killed and injured in accidents than are today with human-driven cars.
5014	0.615384615	With so many distractions becoming available (e.g., smart phones, automated bill board displays) people are becoming less able to drive safely. Autonomous drivers would not have these distractions and would be safer.
5025	0.7142857140000001	Within the US there are 1.25 fatalities per 100 million miles driven. Tesla autopilot (level 2 autonomous) recorded 1 fatality within 130 million miles. Autonomous vehicles will continue to improve, humans can't.

5072	0.181818182	You cant stop it period end of story
5108	0.3	are you crazy? self driving cars will increase road safety if we get it right.
5112	0.5	autonomous cars allows you to work while driving, increasing your productivity.
5116	0.7	autonomous cars can mitigate against human error caused by a typical driver
5120	0.692307692	autonomous cars reduce drivers fatigue during long drives
5121	0.444444444	autonomous cars reduce the need of parking spaces, making cities more beautiful
5123	0.571428571	autonomous cars will act as one connected transportation system as opposed to individual cars, trucks bikes, they will be aware of the fastest routes and keep pollution down
5126	0.7142857140000001	autonomous cars will increase national security by allowing the state to better monitor the roads
5127	0.75	autonomous cars will largely reduce the amount of accidents on the road, because they will not be susceptible to problems that human drivers face like being tired or losing your concentration
5128	0.625	autonomous cars will reduce pollution and help fight global warming
5129	0.5	autonomous cars will reduce the number of car accidents
5130	0.6	autonomous cars will reduce the price of overall products when their delivery and shipping cost decreases
5131	0.333333333	autonomous vehicles can communicate with each other in ways that humans can not to avoid accidents
5132	0.8	autonomous vehicles can help streamline shipping and logistics as a human driver requires stops and sleep
5231	0.923076923	in 2010, 81% of the 5.5 million car accidents in the US were caused by human error. Autonomous cars can lead to a massive reduction in traffic accidents, injuries, and deaths.
5256	0.384615385	it will allow to completely renew the design of vehicles and our experience of transportation
5270	0.5625	machines are much cheaper than humans as they dont require a salary, and this would lower the price of driving services like taxis, public transport, etc
5271	0.75	machines will always obey the rules of the road, and keep passengers and pedestrians safer.
5310	0.8	overall most car accidents are due to human errors. ergo autonomous cars would reduce the number of car accidents and casualities.
5333	0.214285714	road should be used by only autonomous cars in order to leverage machine-only rules

5398	0.25	the is no way to stop the advancement of technology so we should continue developing
5416	0.526315789	these cars will make traveling much easier and more enjoyable, as humans would not have to drive and could instead work, relax etc
5420	0.5	traffic is congested in many metro areas. Humans can use their brain for better task sitting in the car than traffic jam driving. Meanwhile Autonomous cars may handle drive safely
5449	0.272727273	we must continue working on it and test it in a very traffic complicated cities
5454	0.166666667	we should invest the effort in creating road infrastructure that will make autonomous cars trivial to implement
5456	0.2	we should not stop the development, but implementation until we do more testing and create regulation on upcomming issues.
5463	0.473684211	when autonomous cars cause the prices of driving services to decrease, this could mean more people opting for car sharing, taxis, instead of buying a car, thus reducing the amount of cars on the road
5469	0.9	while it is true that self-driving cars don’t get distracted, it is also true they cannot react to ambiguous situations with the same ability of humans which means the two need to work together
