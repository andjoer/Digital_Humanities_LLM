1992	0.6666666666666666	many current workplaces are based on the use and production of fossil fuels, thus banning it will result in great unemployment
2023	0.5294117647058824	Because we are human and can't foresee all the consequences, let's not ban fossil fuels. But let's stop subsidizing them, and their impact to our environment, and then let economics play out.
2106	0.8666666666666667	Fossil fuels are cheap sources of energy the allow us to create and move commodities cheaply, therefore reducing the costs of everything we buy or consume
2195	0.8235294117647058	America became great because of cheap and abundant fossil fuel energy and we have no right to deny the same to other developing countries just because we can afford to subsidize alternative fuels.
2246	0.6	The problem isn't the extraction and use of fossil fuels but the exorbitant demand for energy and efficiency.
2270	0.5294117647058824	"until we develop viable, large scale alternatives, it is silly to preach banning fossil fuels. When cars first replaced horses and all the manure they produced, cars were considered ""green."""

2678	0.6	Most of what we gain from the use of fossil fuel is luxuries. Even if the life in the west will be harmed, it is worth it because of the huge benefits.
2734	0.4	Fossil fuels are located in countries with politically controversial agendas. The mutual dependence of diverse energy producers and buyers create deals and interactions between countries. We need fossils as they are the base for deals.

5261	0.5666666666666667	Given the two main problems with Fossil fuels are that Fossil fuels usage is extremely air pollution and that thay are consumeable, their usage does not immediately harm anyone and so should not be banned.
5355	0.7333333333333333	fossil fuels are a cheap energy source and banning it would greatly increase the price of living
5366	0.8125	"We should not ban fossil fuels because often times they can be less harmful to the environment than manufacturing ""green"" energy sources like solar panels."
5374	0.7	We should not ban fossil fuels because the ban will just cause production to move to less regulated areas, and therefore to become even dirtier.
5575	0.8666666666666667	There are other, less extreme ways to decrease the use and discourage fossil fuels like carbon taxes or ending subsides that wouldn't cause as much of extreme economic turmoil.
