177	0.9333333333333332	If everyone gets the vaccination, Flu may disappear. If only some people are vaccinated and the disease is still spreading it may change in a way that will be immune to the current vaccination.
213	0.9333333333333332	People who can't get vaccinated due to medical reasons depend on herd immunity from mass vaccination of everyone else for protection, mandating vaccines maintains herd immunity.

274	0.6666666666666666	The choice no to get vaccinated is not rational nor informed. Vaccination do work and suggesting they dont is the result of fake news
324	0.7333333333333333	Due to no media content regulations people are subjected to many false facts about vaccinations and are therefore not knowledgeable enough to make the decision to vaccinate or not by themselves.
347	0.8666666666666667	Flu vaccination should be mandatory because people who are healthy enough to receive the vaccine have a moral duty to limit the risk of the flu to those who cannot get the vaccine.
375	0.6666666666666666	It is immoral to spread diseases to others when it can be avoided. This is similar to assaulting others, even if the eventual damage is small.
