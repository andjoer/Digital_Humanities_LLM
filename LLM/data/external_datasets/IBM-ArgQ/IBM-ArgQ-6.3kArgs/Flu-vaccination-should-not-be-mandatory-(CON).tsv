219	0.6666666666666666	The state ought not intervene in individuals' right of bodily autonomy regardless of societal harms. Forcing vaccinations is a crude invasion to someone's body and should therefore not be done.

272	0.4666666666666667	People cannot be forced to buy a product that they do not want to consume as it constitutes a violation of property rights.
373	0.4	Moving the debate to an area which is easier for anti vaccinators because flu vaccination has proportionally not so many upsides. Many people will assume other vaccines are also like that although they're more important.
487	0.7666666666666667	Many minority groups have been historically harmed by medical institutions and so distrust the system, the government shouldn't be forcing these people into that system after being responsible for harm caused.
541	0.8666666666666667	Flu vaccination should not be mandatory because in order to meet the demand for hundreds of millions of units of the vaccine, safety standards would be lowered and people would be given bad vaccines.
655	0.6666666666666666	The flu vaccine barely works anyways since strains of flu change every year.

1063	0.7333333333333333	The vaccination would protect you for just one year, the gain in marginal so the expected value is small compared to the unlikely but significant damage
1150	0.7058823529411765	The government should not intervene in personal medical choices.
1170	0.7333333333333333	Opposition to vaccines is valid as the government and doctors have used their powers to harm marginalized groups before.
1190	0.8	The only way to enforce these kinds of mandates is through fines or jail time, both won't change people's opinions while significantly impeding societal productivity and hurting individuals.
1301	0.8235294117647058	Vaccinations are invasive so the government can educate and encourage but forcing would be tantamount to assault.

1323	0.8666666666666667	if we vaccinate babies and elderly we put them in even a greater danger than being infected with the flu due to all those chemicals that could affect them gravely.
1396	0.9411764705882352	Flu vaccines are relatively safe, but not absolutely safe. Adverse effects, while uncommon, are nonetheless real.
1445	1.0	If more people getting vaccinated would be a public good, the government has other options for increasing rates of vaccination without impeding individual choice, such as educating about the vaccine's benefits and providing tax incentives.
1447	0.7647058823529411	Enforcement of a flu vaccination for adults would be costly and impractical.
1453	0.6470588235294118	Making a treatment with as low a success rate as the flu vaccine mandatory would undermine public trust in any other health mandate it sees fit to issue.

1528	0.5333333333333333	You do not have to make vaccinations mandatory. Positive incentives can be given to people to get vaccinated, thus immunizing most of the population without the use of force.
1570	0.9333333333333332	The government forcing this on their citizens creates a precedent where they can ignore the will of the people.
1584	0.9333333333333332	Most people who don't get flu vaccines don't get them because of expense or physical inaccessibility, it is wrong for the government to mandate something they can't guarantee will be provided.

1953	0.6666666666666666	Forcing parent to vaccinate their children is getting into the way they parent and control it, which is not legitimate.
1955	0.8	The flu vaccine is unpopular amongst a wide portion of the population, thus mandating it would be undemocratic and a violation of the population's political will.
1990	0.7333333333333333	The majority of the time the flu is a very benign disease, it is unfair to mandate the vaccine for all if very few experience real harms either way.
2012	0.8	Flu vaccination should not be mandatory because it will lead to a backlash against vaccines that will harm public health overall.
2053	1.0	Vaccinations have side effects of pain and weakness, and their effectiveness is only partial. A person has the right and the ability to make a conscious decision whether to vaccinate himself or not.

2078	0.8666666666666667	The flu vaccine is relatively painful and could cause short-term pain and weakness. It is illegitimate to force people to undertake it against their will.
2160	0.7058823529411765	Vaccines can contain ingredients some people consider immoral or otherwise objectionable.
2221	0.8666666666666667	The government shouldn't pass policies that are likely to disproportionately target sub-sects of the population since this is unfair and entrenches cycles of oppression, mandating flu vaccines disproportionately hurts poorer people and people of color.
2227	0.8	People are already well aware of the harms of the flu and the benefits of vaccination, meaning that the government should allow people to make the decisions they deem best for themselves.
2302	0.8333333333333334	The flu vaccine can be incredibly costly, meaning that a large increase in government spending would be necessary in order to facilitate this mandate.
2312	0.8666666666666667	If the government prioritizes group rights above individual rights, it removes personal freedoms.
2316	0.4	The disease would grow stronger by mutating on the entire population, it is best to save it for really sick oeople
2329	0.7058823529411765	The pharmaceutical companies, FDA, and CDC should not be trusted to make and regulate safe vaccines.
2352	0.6	Some religious beliefs are against vaccinations, and it's not legitimate for the state to intervene in that.

2446	0.6	There are legitimate risks in taking any vaccinations, like mix ups or unclean needles. Given that the negative consequences of the flue are pretty mild, it's legitimate to prioritize one over the other.
2449	0.6470588235294118	People have a right to decide what to put into their own bodies, the government can't tell me to get a flu shot.

2579	0.6	Religious reasons not to get vaccinated are more important than marginally contributing to herd immunity since the potential for hell is infinite.
2652	0.8666666666666667	Vaccination is very invasive, it is a needle going into a person's body. It is not legitimate to invade like that to a person's privacy and body.

2929	0.6333333333333333	The bar for taking away people's rights for public health systems specifically is high - private car emissions cause a lot of health risks, but we prioritize individual rights in those cases.

2962	1.0	People have legitimate personal reasons not to get vaccinated and should get to make the decision personally since they are the primary person effected by the disease later (especially since other still get it).
3067	0.8	Flu vaccination should not be mandatory because individuals know their own preferences and interests better than experts or government officials.
3093	0.8666666666666667	The government cannot restrain people and administer vaccines, as it would be a violation of bodily autonomy.
3116	0.9333333333333332	Coercion and threats via government mandate prevent long-term successful health policy by making people feel attacked, which means you will have more backlash against flu vaccines than if you just negotiated with people rationally.

3761	0.8	Flu vaccination should not be mandatory because it is unnecessary to protect the public from the flu - enough people opt in freely to limit its spread.
3768	0.6666666666666666	The flu vaccine is ineffective at preventing disease and won't save lives.
3772	0.7058823529411765	Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases, thus making vaccines unnecessary.
3773	0.7419354838709677	Mandating flu vaccination pads the pockets of large pharmaceutical company at the cost of individuals who don't want the vaccine.

4027	0.7333333333333333	Vaccination is risky becose you might get sick and forcing someone to take that risk is unethical
4060	0.8	The harm caused by the flu isn't large enough to justify this level of intrusion into people's freedom of choice. This may be legitimate for measles, but not flu.
4108	0.8064516129032258	The public does not support this kind of policy and the government must always prioritize the will of the people.

4473	0.7333333333333333	When we force vaccines, we take away the incentives for the health system to engage with the public and explain the importance of vaccines. In the long terms, this leads to less public trust.

4503	0.8	The government have no Legitimacy to force people to vaccinate themselves
4521	0.8666666666666667	Herd immunity isn't possible because the flu changes entirely every year and severely sick and children can't be vaccinated. So the potential gain is minimal while a lot of harm can occur from complications.
