106	0.8666666666666667	By making it legal, we can also monitor it, which would end the more serious problems of forcing people to dope against their will, and people overdosing because of lack of knowledge &amp; supervision.
126	0.6	Gives more inspiration to people by seeing athletes reading higher achievements
154	0.6	We should legalize doping in sport because it is a victim-less crime.
192	0.75	Doping happens today in all major sports leagues anyway, but athletes who become addicted and suffer bodily harms are unable to report and get help due to the ban.
226	0.7333333333333333	Prevents athletes from dying and disease because of more regulation on the use of drugs which happens anyway
247	0.5882352941176471	If legal, sports such as the Olympics would be the result of human creativity and choice, not a very expensive horse race.
267	0.4705882352941176	So many athletes are doping anyhow, we should just let them do it out in the open.
293	0.8	The quality of sports will increase since people will be physically better.

453	0.5294117647058824	A lot of activities are far more dangerous than performance enhancing drugs and we don't ban those things, like bungee jumping or riding motorcycles.
456	0.7333333333333333	Many of these drugs are used in medicine. Using them in sports will incentivise more research into them since sports is a very profitable field.
466	0.8	Insofar as athletes with access to illegal performance enhancing drugs and top doctors will always exist, it is fairer to legalize doping so everyone has access to these drugs.
473	0.6666666666666666	Testing athletes will never catch everyone who dopes, which means some cheaters will always get through, it is preferable to just legalize doping for everyone.
509	0.7333333333333333	We should legalize doping in sport because it levels the play field for people who have naturally lower hormone levels compared to those with naturally higher levels.
510	0.7333333333333333	Athletes should have the right to do what they want to their own body, even if some worry it is unsafe - we allow people to do things that could hurt themselves all the time.
523	0.8666666666666667	Drugs are just an extension to human abillitie like any other gear such as shoes or diving suits because they affect everyone the same, so legalizing them should be no different than legalizing shoes

571	0.7333333333333333	drugs helping the athletes to get to new records and this is way people love watching sports. more records = more jobs for athelets.
588	0.5333333333333333	Steroids are often prescribed by doctors for recovery efforts, which can create false positives or push people out of sports if they need steroids.
615	0.5882352941176471	Doping is not illegal. The sports management controls what is allowed for the good of the sport

649	0.8	Legalizing doping in sport will open up entire new markets that will create jobs and motivate economic activity.
691	0.8666666666666667	Legalizing doping would prevent situations in which athletes who are taking drugs legally for their health get punished (such as when human growth hormone is used post-injury).
749	0.5333333333333333	Doping will enhance athletes performance and there for they will be able to break new records. breaking new records is an achievement that pushes athletes to excellency.
753	0.8	People enjoy watching sporting events in order to see records broken. Seeing as the human body has a natural limit, but medicine (and doping substances) keeps improving, it would keep people interested in sports.
773	0.8	Doping is happening anyway, but with regulations we can have athletes use less harmful drugs so there's less people dying because of doping
827	0.5333333333333333	Already today many athlets use drugs, but these drugs are medically verified because they aren't regulated, which means the illegal drugs are more likely to harm the participants
920	0.9333333333333332	Doping counteracts much more arbitrary factors in athleticism like genetic predisposition, thus making sports more fair by giving people a chance regardless of their genes.
923	0.8666666666666667	Athletes who dope are capable of achieving greater athletic feats, which brings more entertainment for viewers and followers of sports.
967	0.8666666666666667	People like to watch people perform superhuman acts. The use of drugs will significantly increase the abilities of athletes, will make sport more interesting and exciting and thus will provide greater enjoyment to viewers.
993	0.8	Switching from a full on ban to regulation is more enforceable than the status quo.
1008	0.25	When we catch an athlete who dope we don't solve the problem because he may be one among many but we do lower the reputation of athletes and sports.

1114	0.8666666666666667	We should legalize doping in sport because the law right now is almost unenforceable, which reduces people's respect for the law, because it is so easily flaunted.
1258	0.5294117647058824	People watch sports to see professional athletes do great feats, allowing PEDs will make sports more entertaining.

1325	1.0	The illegal doping black market endangers athletes' lives, and it would be safer to legalize and regulate it.
1409	0.5625	Letting athletes to dope will allow us to examine what is the maximum human capacity o physical activity.

1623	0.8	We should legalize doping in sport because criminalizing doping leads to newer, more dangerous drugs that are not tested for replacing better studied and understood drugs.
1653	0.8	We should legalize doping in sport because there is no compelling public health interest in banning doping.

1779	0.9333333333333332	We should legalize doping in sport because doping will go on either way, but if it is legal it will be safer and better regulated.

2335	0.4	Doping is happening in any case, we we should accept it.
2348	0.5625	Every human has a right to do anything to himself, since it's no danger to others and therefore the state has no right banning him from doing it.
2350	0.8235294117647058	Doping correctly managed by legalization, will increase safety for himself/herself.
2399	0.7333333333333333	Countries use doping regardless since the drugs are hard to notice. Allowing all countries to use it will make the competition more equal.

2460	0.7333333333333333	Current methods of legally doping (like hypoxic tents that increase hematocrit) are much more expensive than regular doping will be after legalization, which will serve to make the same tools more accessible to everyone.
2468	1.0	Legalization of doping prevents us from having to decide which drugs are too enhancing (for example, why creatine isn't considered performance enhancing while erythropoeitian is), which is a necessarily arbitrary process.
2477	0.7333333333333333	We should legalize doping in sport because it will allow athletes to recover from injuries and prolong their careers better.
2585	0.7333333333333333	The state can get money from taxation and export of these drugs
2688	1.0	Doping will happen either way illegally - people just depend on not getting caught, legalizing it provides equal access to everyone which makes sports more fair.
2701	0.8125	By making it legal, we can also monitor it, which would end the more serious problems of forcing people to dope against their will, and people overdosing because of lack of knowledge & supervision.

2809	0.6666666666666666	Legalizing doping makes sports fairer. Right now when a few athletes dope they gain a huge advantage which makes sports unfair, but legalizing doping evens the playing field.

2950	0.8	The rich would no longer command great advantages in sports because of their economic advantage letting them afford better training, coaching, and the like. Doping could compensate for resource differences.
3018	0.6666666666666666	In the status quo athletes buy their steroids from corrupt doctors or black markets where safety of the drug cannot be guaranteed, legalization creates regulatory bodies that will insure the safety of drug composition.
3022	0.6666666666666666	Legalizing doping represents an adaptation to new technology and is a natural progression of the rules in the same way that sport adapted to better athletic clothing and shoes.

3038	0.4666666666666667	"It depends on what you mean by doping. Some ""doping"" is done with substances that are readily available to all athletes, so it is fair."
3059	0.6666666666666666	Doping becomes safer. When athletes dope right now they have to do it in risky ways, and don't go to doctors for help. Legalizing it encourages regulation.
3099	0.1176470588235294	As there is no level play , so let sportsmen have choice to to Mach in competition.

3329	0.8	Sports are ultimately are businesses and should frame there decision making around what best draws the most views to make more money: doping allows for a continuous power creep fulfilling this burden.

3398	0.7333333333333333	If doping were legal, the free market would regulate the prices to make it cheaper than when it is sold in the illegal market, this enabling low-income athletes to compete with high-income athletes.
3438	0.6	Currently, doping does take place and often goes undetected. Therefore, the ban mostly means that athletes who play by the rules are less likelyto win.
3445	0.875	The purpose of sport is primarily entertainment, and doping leads to more amazing performances from athletes, meaning that legalizing doping would improve the fan experience.
3534	0.8	Human race will reach its limit dinner or latter but new drugs will develop endlessly , so it means that sport will get better endlessly
3556	0.8	The infrastructure supporting anti-doping is incredibly expensive and wastes a lot of money and energy, requiring millions of dollars in testing and monitoring.
3648	0.8	Doping is no different than other performance-enhancing techniques being used in sports today
3653	0.6666666666666666	We should legalize doping in sport because most people probably want better sports and thus democratic will supports legalization.

3717	0.7647058823529411	Trying to stop doing is expensive and futile, getting rid of the doping ban would mean less cheating and more focus on the sport.
3838	0.8666666666666667	Even though some doping drugs are dangerous, there are plenty that we know aren't, so we might as well legalize those.

4256	0.4666666666666667	People should be allowed to do with their body as they wish, and sports organizations should not limit individuals bodily autonomy by banning doping.
4257	0.75	Sports are about seeing how far we can push our physical limits and using performance enhancing drugs does just that - allows us to push the limits of our physical abilities.
4258	0.9333333333333332	Because doping is beneficial for athletes' recovery times, legalizing doping would allow for athletes to have longer, more productive careers where they can maximize the short window of their athletic peak.
4275	0.8823529411764706	As long as doping is illegal, the focus will be on making the drugs undetectable - but if it were legal, they could make the drugs safer.

4313	0.625	Athletes already choose to risk their health for the purposes of athletic achievements. This is the rationale behind sports and doping allows them to achieve it.
