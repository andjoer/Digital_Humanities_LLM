12	0.7333333333333333	The environment is at a tipping point, so if we ban fossil fuels now we can reverse the damage done to it, but if we don't the damage would be irreversible
34	0.8	fossil fuels are a massive polluter, the use of which leads to climate change, destruction of habitats and more natural disasters.
53	0.9	Banning Fossil fuels will accelerate the technological development of environment friendly fuels. Making a progress in this field will make the new fuels cheaper, and it will benefit the environment in the long run.
76	0.9333333333333332	fossil fuels are limited, thus expected to become more scarce and expensive through time. we will need to switch to renewable energy eventually, the more we wait, the more dependent we become.
83	0.7333333333333333	There is economy of scale when using different sources and the more they are used, the cheaper and more efficient they get. Fossil fuels prevent the transfer because of this.
