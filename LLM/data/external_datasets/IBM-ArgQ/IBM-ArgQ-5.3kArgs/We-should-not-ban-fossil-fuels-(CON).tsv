76	0.7692307690000001	Access to technologies that rely on renewables (like electric cars) is limited to the wealthy, and so this will mostly harm poorer people who have no other choice besides relying on fossil fuels
84	0.0	Actually servers and server farms represent 5% of the energy useage in the US. Should we ban those, too? Bye bye Internet.
140	0.727272727	America became great because of cheap and abundant fossil fuel energy and we have no right to deny the same to other developing countries just because we can afford to subsidize alternative fuels.
526	0.333333333	Banning Fossil fuels is not economically physible as there is no widespread alternative energy solution as of now.
534	0.36842105299999994	Banning fossil fuel will increase the price of renewable energies constructions

594	0.333333333	Because we are human and can't foresee all the consequences, let's not ban fossil fuels. But let's stop subsidizing them, and their impact to our environment, and then let economics play out.
706	0.545454545	Changing from fossil fuels to clean energy is a highly costly move because the government would have to build new nuclear power plants, at the expense of using that money to deal better with pollution
776	0.85	Countries that sell fossil fuels are currently largely dependent on them for their budget and social needs. If fossil fuels are banned, they could face severe reprecussions and even regime collapse.
777	0.5	Countries try to break dependence of controversial countries and want to create more stable market. Thus they are already looking for alternative energy sources. No need to entirely ban.
778	0.6	Creating energy from fossil fuels is relatively cheap, which is reflected in the cost of fossil-energy based devices, allowing people from poor economic background to have a broad use of technology. This leads to social mobolity.
1129	0.5555555560000001	Fossil fuel resources are largely located in a small amount of countries with controversial political agendas. World's dependence on fossil-fuel based technologies put great power.

1584	0.25	Hurts specifically developing countries which depend more on Fossil fuels than developed countries, while developing countries need more help
1694	0.545454545	If one country bans fossil fuels those companies will just move to other countries, meaning that your nation accrues all the economic harms without making a dent in global warming.
1721	0.7142857140000001	If we ban fossil fuels too quickly, this could have a negative effect on society because it might slow down or eliminate transportation options for some people.
1785	0.41666666700000005	In places with extreme weather conditions walking to public transportation or not being able to heat your house can be very dangerous.
1916	0.41666666700000005	It's going to take decades for us to reduce our dependency and re-tool for life without fossil fuels. Even if we want to, we can't. Yet.

2076	0.636363636	Jobs destroyed by a ban won't be replaced with jobs for as low of a level of education (since greener energy needs more researchers and engineers than miners), leaving many permanently out of work.
2165	0.545454545	Lots of places rely on the money from selling oil, so banning fossil fuels would collapse the economy.
2211	0.8888888890000001	Many institutions and businesses have money invested in fossil fuels, a ban would destroy the economy and those institutions.
2234	0.75	Many poorer countries, such as Nigeria, rely on fossil fuels for a large part of their income. If fossil fuels are banned, they will become much poorer, while the gains will go mostly to the West.
2319	0.8888888890000001	Most of the benefits of banning fossil fuels can be achieved with just taxation, and that leaves the possibility for people and companies that really need it to use it.
2322	0.375	Most of what we gain from the use of fossil fuel is luxuries. Even if the life in the west will be harmed, it is worth it because of the huge benefits.

3030	0.6	Since I can't extract my own oil or harvest my own natural gas, I can only use the fossil resources that government provides, so banning those fuels would mean government would have to provide better alternatives.
3858	0.5	Solar, wind, and biomass can never replace even a small fraction of the reliable fossil fuel energy that powers our modern industrial civilization.
3986	0.857142857	The alternatives to fossil fuels right now are much more polluting because they consume more energy
4002	0.894736842	The ban on fossil fuels will lead to a heavy reliance on energy sources that are highly pollutant and hazardous such as nuclear energy.
4099	0.41666666700000005	The government shouldn't pass policies without the popular consent of the citizens, banning fossil fuels would be incredibly unpopular.
4149	0.7	The massive economic trouble that this will cause will prevent the advances still needed to make renewable energy sources economically viable, by stalling research funding and possible monetary support
4171	0.6315789470000001	The most likely alternative to fossil fuels in the short term is nuclear energy, which could lead to disasters and increase the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
4200	0.41176470600000004	The problem isn't the extraction and use of fossil fuels but the exorbitant demand for energy and efficiency.
4205	0.46153846200000004	The production of the electricity for the currently available alternative energies is still largely dependent on power plants, which are themselves dependent on fossil fuels. We are not ready.
4223	0.545454545	The reason why there aren't enough alternatives is because we lack knowledge on ther energy sources. Banning fossil fules may urge to produce energy from potentially more dangerous sources like atomic energy.
4250	0.363636364	The staggering amounts of money involved in executing global climate change initiatives leads to unavoidable (and already demonstrated) self enrichment/political abuse. Who can we trust? Banning fossil fuels is simply fantasy.
4294	0.6	There aren't enough viable alternatives for fossil fuels, so we won't have things like electricity, therefore millions will die
4323	0.6	There are not enough cheap alternatives to fossil fuels, banning it at this stage can make entire cities collapse for lack of power.
4325	0.8888888890000001	There are other, less extreme ways to decrease the use and discourage fossil fuels like carbon taxes or ending subsides that wouldn't cause as much of extreme economic turmoil.

4411	0.8	This removes the only competitive advantage that many developing countries have - selling natural resources. This means they will have no way to survive
4453	0.0	Today monopolies are controlling the energy market by controlling resources, it is illegitimate to deny more companies of the chance to step into that market just because they weren't given resources by the government
4455	0.6	Today we are too much dependent on fossil fuels and the share of clean energy is not high enough, so we can't ban it with no sufficient alternatives
4681	0.7	We already have all of the infrastructure for fossil fuels, making them cheap and reliable, this will not be the case for alternative energy which will cause massive inconsistency in people receiving their energy.

4709	0.36842105299999994	We don't have another effician energy source to replace it. And we have to have energy
4720	0.444444444	We have already taken global warming too far, fossil fuels will prove a higher standard of living while we wait out the clock.
4727	0.636363636	We may not fully know or understand all of the consequences of switching to alternative energy technologies. There could be hidden reasons why switching would cause more harm than continuing on our current path.
4744	0.8	We probably will find ways to solve global worming in the future, harming people today in order to maybe help the people of the future is not legitimate.
4837	0.7777777779999999	We should not ban fossil fuels because despite what we would wish, there is no viable alternative yet, and it is unethical to use people's suffering as a means to an end to develop one.

4842	0.818181818	We should not ban fossil fuels because it would actually be more wasteful to stop using perfectly good infrastructure decades before it wears out, especially given the huge up front costs.
4843	0.7777777779999999	We should not ban fossil fuels because it would cause international chaos as economies like Russia and Brazil lost huge industries and had to scramble to replace them.
4844	0.5	We should not ban fossil fuels because it would cause massive public backlash against the environmental movement.
4845	0.625	We should not ban fossil fuels because it would dramatically limit the use of container ships and undermine international trade.
