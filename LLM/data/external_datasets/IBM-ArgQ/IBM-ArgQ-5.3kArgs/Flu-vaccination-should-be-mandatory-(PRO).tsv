41	0.428571429	A government mandate on flu vaccines will standardize vaccine policy across the nation where there is currently variability depending on the state that prevents people from being able to predict what they should be doing.
49	0.7	A mandatory flu vaccination creates a positive habit in people regarding vaccinations and regular medical treatments in general.
79	0.75	According to the BMJ, Flu vaccines are estimated to prevent thousands of admissions and millions of illnesses annually with current usage.
94	0.583333333	Adverse reactions to vaccines are extremely rare, with the most common (anaphylaxis) occurring in one per several hundred thousand to one per one million vaccinations.
100	0.8	Aggregate benefits of vaccination always outweigh negative individual results.
223	0.454545455	At what point does the public good outweigh an individual's rights? Where does a government draw that line? The public must be protected from the risk of illness.

1000	0.857142857	Economicly better for the society - vacsenation will prevent people from getting sick , causing more people to go to work ---> more tax money
1012	0.8	Even if flu vaccines aren't 100% effective, the chance of effectiveness is worth mandating vaccination since there are so few risks to people getting them that even one additionally prevented case is worth it.
1018	0.428571429	Even if some people refuse to get the vaccine, if many people decide to get it they will allow the entire population to be protected.
1070	0.666666667	Familiarity and personal experience with vaccines will cause more (and especially poorer) people to increase trust in them. This will lead to more vaccinations against more serious diseases, helping prevent many unnecessary illnesses and deaths.

1093	0.8888888890000001	"Flu vaccination should be mandatory because vaccines rely on a ""herd immunity"" effect in order to be effective, which is compromised if individuals who are able to get the vaccine do not do so."
1094	1.0	Flu vaccination should be mandatory because when most people get the flu vaccine, it helps protect the population as a whole. This is because there are fewer infected people to transmit the highly contagious illness.

1768	0.857142857	In developing countries where the flu is more likely to have intense adverse effects due to poor sanitation and lack of treatment, the flu vaccine prevents having to deal with a health crisis later.

2079	0.46666666700000003	Just like with other regulations, if there are some groups that have justifiable reasons to avoid the flu vaccine, such as religious considerations, flu vaccination should still be mandatory, only with rooms for exemptions.

2138	0.571428571	Life and health are a prerequisite to accessing any other human rights, and because the flu vaccine facilitates both of these the government should intervene to mandate the vaccine and maximizing access to rights.
